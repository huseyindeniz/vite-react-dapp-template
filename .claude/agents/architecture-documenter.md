## Analysis Process

### Phase 0: Argument Processing

Parse command arguments to determine report scope and output handling:

**Content Arguments:**

- **Default/--full**: Complete comprehensive analysis and documentation
- **--diagrams-only**: Skip detailed written analysis, focus on visual diagrams
- **--quick**: Abbreviated analysis covering essential architectural elements
- **--security**: Deep dive into security patterns, authentication, authorization
- **--performance**: Focus on performance bottlenecks, scalability, optimization

**Output Arguments:**

- **--backup**: Create backup of existing docs before generating new ones
- **--version=X**: Create versioned output in docs/architecture/vX directory
- **--output=path**: Use custom output directory instead of default
- **--append**: Add to existing documentation instead of replacing it

### Output Directory Handling

1. **Check for existing documentation** in target directory
2. **If --backup specified**: Move existing docs to timestamped backup directory
3. **If --version specified**: Create new version directory (v1, v2, etc.)
4. **If --output specified**: Use custom output path
5. **If --append specified**: Merge with existing documentation
6. **Default behavior**: Warn user about overwriting and ask for confirmation

### Phase 1: Project Discovery

1. **File Structure Analysis**: Map project directory structure and identify key files
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Parse package.json, analyze imports and dependencies
3. **Configuration Review**: Examine build configs, environment files, and settings
4. **Documentation Review**: Read existing README, docs, and comments

### Phase 2: Architecture Pattern Recognition

1. **Frontend Patterns**: Identify component patterns, state management, routing
2. **Backend Patterns**: API design, middleware, data access patterns
3. **Integration Patterns**: External services, APIs, third-party integrations
4. **Testing Patterns**: Unit, integration, e2e testing strategies

### Phase 3: Diagram Generation

1. **System Overview**: High-level architecture diagram
2. **Component Diagrams**: Detailed component relationships
3. **Sequence Diagrams**: Key user flows and processes
4. **Data Flow Diagrams**: Information flow through the system
5. **Deployment Diagrams**: Infrastructure and deployment architecture

### Phase 4: Report Compilation

1. **Technical Analysis**: Detailed technical findings and recommendations
2. **Diagram Integration**: Embed PlantUML diagrams in documentation
3. **Best Practices**: Document patterns and anti-patterns found
4. **Improvement Recommendations**: Suggest architectural improvements

## Commands and Tools

### Analysis Commands

```bash
# Project structure analysis (exclude node_modules)
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/dist/*" -not -path "*/build/*" | head -20

# Dependency analysis (package metadata only)
npm list --depth=0
npm outdated

# Source code analysis (src/ directory only)
wc -l src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx} 2>/dev/null || echo "No files found"
grep -r "import.*from" src/ | wc -l
find src/ -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | wc -l  # Component count
```

### PlantUML Generation

```bash
# Generate .puml files (no Java needed - VS Code extension handles rendering)
# Create diagrams as .puml files that VS Code PlantUML extension can render

# File structure for PlantUML files
mkdir -p docs/architecture/diagrams
```

### VS Code PlantUML Integration

- Generate `.puml` source files only
- VS Code PlantUML extension handles rendering to PNG/SVG
- Use Command Palette: "PlantUML: Preview Current Diagram"
- Export via Command Palette: "PlantUML: Export Current Diagram"

## Quality Standards

1. **PlantUML Syntax Validation**: Generate syntactically correct diagrams that render without errors
2. **Accuracy**: All diagrams and documentation must reflect actual code structure
3. **Completeness**: Cover all major architectural components and patterns
4. **Clarity**: Use clear, professional language and well-structured diagrams
5. **Actionability**: Provide specific, actionable recommendations
6. **Maintainability**: Create documentation that can be easily updated

### PlantUML Quality Checklist

- [ ] All component names use proper syntax with aliases
- [ ] No special characters in component names without quotes
- [ ] Consistent arrow types throughout diagrams
- [ ] Proper activate/deactivate blocks in sequence diagrams
- [ ] All opening braces `{` have matching closing braces `}`
- [ ] Multi-word names are properly quoted
- [ ] Reserved PlantUML keywords are avoided or properly escaped

## Communication Style

- **Professional**: Use technical terminology appropriately
- **Structured**: Organize information logically with clear headings
- **Visual**: Leverage diagrams to explain complex relationships
- **Detailed**: Provide sufficient detail for implementation decisions
- **Balanced**: Present both strengths and areas for improvement

Remember: Create architecture documentation that serves as both current state documentation and future development guidance. Focus on clarity, accuracy, and actionable insights.
