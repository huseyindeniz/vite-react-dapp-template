Test Coverage Check
================================================================================

Running test coverage (this may take a moment)...

Coverage Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Statements:  16.67%
Branches:    11.10%
Functions:   14.82%
Lines:       16.52%

Average:     15%

⚠️  Test coverage is 15% (< 60% threshold)

Coverage by File:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Lowest coverage files (top 10):

    0% - vite-env.d.ts
    0% - src/features/app
    0% - App.tsx
    0% - ...pp/config/auth
    0% - ...ectionType.ts
    0% - ...text-providers
    0% - ...Providers.tsx
    0% - ...roviders/types
    0% - Provider.ts
    0% - ProviderEntry.ts

Recommendations:
  1. Add .test.ts(x) files for business logic and utilities
  2. Focus on critical paths first (authentication, state management, etc.)
  3. Aim for at least 60% coverage baseline
  4. Run "npm run coverage" to see detailed coverage report

================================================================================
Summary: Coverage at 15% (target: 60%)
================================================================================

### ❌ Storybook Coverage

================================================================================
Storybook Coverage Check
================================================================================

Analyzing Storybook story files for UI components...

Story Coverage Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total components:         0
Story files:              13
Components without stories: 0
Story coverage:           ~0%

⚠️  Story coverage is 0% (< 40% threshold)

Recommendations:
  1. Add .stories.ts(x) files for reusable UI components
  2. Document component props, variants, and states
  3. Use Storybook for visual regression testing
  4. Focus on design system components first (buttons, inputs, etc.)

Benefits of Storybook:
  - Component documentation
  - Visual testing and debugging
  - Isolated component development
  - Design system showcase

================================================================================
Summary: Story coverage at 0% (target: 40%)
================================================================================
```

## Passed Checks

- ✅ **Test TODOs** - 0 TODO(s)

## Testing Principles Verified

This audit ensures the following testing practices:

### ✅ Test Coverage
- Adequate test files for business logic
- Reasonable baseline coverage (60%+)
- Critical paths tested

### ✅ Visual Testing
- Storybook stories for UI components
- Component documentation and examples
- Design system coverage

### ✅ Test Quality
- No incomplete tests (TODOs)
- Tests are maintained and up-to-date
- Test infrastructure is clean

## Recommendations

### Priority Actions

1. **Test Coverage**: 15% coverage
   - Run: `node ./.claude/skills/test-audit/scripts/test_coverage.mjs`
   - See detailed output above for specific gaps

2. **Storybook Coverage**: See details
   - Run: `node ./.claude/skills/test-audit/scripts/storybook_coverage.mjs`
   - See detailed output above for specific gaps

## Next Steps

1. Address failed checks in priority order
2. Run individual check scripts for detailed analysis
3. Re-run `test-audit` after improvements to verify progress
4. Run your test runner (vitest, jest) for accurate coverage metrics
5. Consider running `code-audit` and `arch-audit` for complete analysis
