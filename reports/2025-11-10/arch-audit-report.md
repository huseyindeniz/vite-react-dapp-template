## Architectural Principles Verified

This audit ensures the following architectural patterns:

### ✅ Feature Isolation
- Core features (infrastructure) don't depend on domain features
- Domain features can depend on core features
- Features use proper boundaries and interfaces

### ✅ Dependency Injection
- Services are only imported in composition root (`src/config/` directory)
- Can be organized as root `services.ts` or feature-specific `{feature}/services.ts`
- Features receive services through dependency injection
- No direct service imports scattered throughout the codebase

### ✅ Model-Based Architecture
- Domain features organize code by models
- Each model has its own directory
- Models expose proper interfaces for cross-model communication

### ✅ Encapsulation
- Model internals (actionEffects, types) are not imported externally
- Slice and saga files follow proper import rules
- Pages and services maintain proper boundaries

### ✅ Circular Dependency Prevention
- Module dependencies form a proper DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- No circular imports that cause bundling or runtime issues

## Recommendations

🎉 **All architecture checks passed!** Your codebase follows excellent architectural patterns.

## Next Steps

1. Address failed checks in priority order
2. Run individual check scripts for detailed violation analysis
3. Re-run `arch-audit` after fixes to verify improvements
4. Consider running `code-audit` for code quality checks
